# TarotReading
Automated daily Tarot reading.

I decided to automate a reading my brother did everyday.

The meaning of the cards:
  Three cards are drawn:
    1) The first represents you, how you are at the moment of the reading.
    2) The second is a problem you will face today.
    3) The third is the solution to that problem.
